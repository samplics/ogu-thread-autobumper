# ogu-thread-autobumper
Thread autobumper for OGUsers.com

- I mostly made this for myself, so unless you understand how to get cookies and site headers this script is gonna be very hard to use

- post_key is achieveable by posting a reply to a thread and looking at the request headers.
- post_hash is achieveable by posting a reply (TO THE THREAD YOU WANT TO AUTOBUMP) and looking at the request headers.
- the rest of the config requirements are achieveable by looking in the browser cookies.

- script autobumps once per hour (you can change ig)
